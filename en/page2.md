## Essential criteria to consider

Choosing the right non-stick pan can make all the difference in the kitchen. Here are the main criteria to consider:

### 1\. **Non-stick coating**
- **Teflon** non-stick coatings are popular, but **ceramic** or **titanium** options are also available. 
- **Teflon**: Easy to use, but may deteriorate at high temperatures.
- **Ceramics**: Best option for those looking for chemical-free alternatives.
- **Titanium**: Highly resistant and durable, but more expensive.

### 2\. **Pan material**
- **Aluminium**: Lightweight, heats up quickly but is less durable.
- **Stainless steel**: Robust and resistant, but needs more care to prevent food from sticking.
- **Cast iron**: Ultra-durable and excellent heat retention, but heavier and requires regular maintenance.

### 3\. **Compatibility with heat sources**
Check that the pan is compatible with your type of cooking: - **Induction**: Requires magnetic bottom. - **Electric, gas and glass-ceramic**: Almost all stoves work with these sources.

> **Tip**: If you have an induction hob, make sure the pan has a thick base for even heat distribution.

### 4\. **Shape and size**
- **Size**: Choose the right pan for your needs. A 20-28 cm frying pan is suitable for most dishes.
- **Edges**: The high edges are perfect for sauces, while the low edges make cooking pancakes and omelettes easier.

### 5\. **Handle**
- **Bakelite handle**: Heat-resistant, but not ovenproof.
- **Removable handle**: Convenient for easy storage and ovenproofing.
- **Metal handle**: Oven-safe, but beware of heat when handling.

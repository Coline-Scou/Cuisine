# 🥞 Traditional Pancake Recipe

<img src="../image crepes.jpg" alt="Description de l&apos;image" />


## Ingredients (for about 10 pancakes)

- **250g flour**
- **3 eggs**
- **1/2 liter** milk
- **1 pinch** salt
- **1 tablespoon** sugar (optional, for sweet pancakes)
- **2 tablespoons** melted butter (or oil)
- **1 tablespoon** rum or vanilla extract (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Preparing the dough**.
   - In a large bowl, sift flour and add a pinch of salt and, if desired, sugar for sweet pancakes.
   - Make a well in the center and break in the eggs.
   - Mix gently with a whisk, gradually adding the milk to avoid lumps.
   - Add melted butter or oil, and flavoring (rum or vanilla) if using.
   - **Tip**: If the dough is too thick, add a little water or milk to make it more fluid.


2. **Resting the dough**:
   - Leave the dough to rest for **30 minutes** at room temperature. This allows the ingredients to bind together properly, resulting in lighter pancakes.


3. **Pancake cooking**:
   - Heat a [non-stick frying pan](page2.md) over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.
   - Pour a small ladleful of batter into the pan and swirl quickly to distribute the batter evenly.
   - Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the edges begin to pull away.
   - Turn the pancake over and cook for a further 1 minute on the other side.
   - **Tip**: Lightly grease the pan between each pancake to prevent sticking.
